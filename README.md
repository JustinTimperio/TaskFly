# TaskFly

**Distributed task orchestration made simple.**

TaskFly is a powerful CLI tool and daemon for deploying and managing distributed applications across cloud infrastructure. It provides a simple yet flexible way to spin up multiple nodes, distribute configuration, and run tasks across your cloud environment.

It was designed and built because I didn't have the time to invest in a full blown Kubernetes setup for small to medium scale distributed workloads that are one-off or short-lived. TaskFly aims to fill that gap with a lightweight, easy-to-use solution. It is ideal for cases like:

- Running distributed batch data processing jobs
- Spinning up small clusters for testing or development of ephemeral workloads
- Rapid prototyping of distributed applications  

**TaskFly is currently in early development.** While the core functionality is in place, expect ongoing improvements, new features, and bug fixes. This was written with the power of vibe coding in a single afternoon so take that as you will. Contributions are welcome!

## Architecture

TaskFly consists of three main components:

### 1. TaskFly CLI (`taskfly`)
The client-side command-line interface for managing deployments. Features include:
- Bundle and deploy applications
- Interactive REPL shell for managing deployments
- Real-time dashboard with live metrics (refreshes every second)
- Docker-compose style log streaming
- Deployment status monitoring

### 2. TaskFly Daemon (`taskflyd`)
The server-side daemon that handles:
- Cloud infrastructure provisioning
- Node registration and authentication
- Configuration distribution
- Deployment lifecycle management
- Distributed log collection and storage
- System metrics aggregation
- Health monitoring and cleanup

### 3. TaskFly Agent (`taskfly-agent`)
Lightweight agent deployed to each node that:
- Registers with the daemon
- Downloads application bundles
- Executes setup scripts
- Streams logs back to daemon (every 2 seconds)
- Collects and reports system metrics (CPU, memory, load)
- Sends regular heartbeats

- üßπ **Automatic Cleanup** - Built-in cleanup for completed deployments
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Multi-Cloud Ready** - Extensible architecture for multiple cloud providers

## Quick Start

### Starting the Daemon

The taskflyd daemon can be started with default or custom settings and runs in memory. In most cases, you should dedicate a server or VM to run the daemon continuously.

```bash
# Start with default settings (localhost:8080)
taskflyd

# Start with custom settings
taskflyd --listen-ip 10.0.0.1 --listen-port 8080 --daemon-ip <your-reachable-ip>

# With verbose logging
taskflyd --verbose
```

### Deploying an Application

1. Create a `taskfly.yml` configuration file in your project directory (similar to a docker-compose file). Example:

```yaml
cloud_provider: "aws"  # or "gcp", "azure" (coming soon)

instance_config:
  aws:
    region: "us-west-2"
    instance_type: "t3.micro"
    ami: "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"

# Files to bundle and distribute to nodes
application_files:
  - "app.py"
  - "requirements.txt"
  - "config.json"

# Where files will be extracted on remote nodes
remote_dest_dir: "/opt/myapp"

# Script to run after setup (optional)
remote_script_to_run: "setup.sh"

# Name of the bundle file (optional)
bundle_name: "myapp_bundle.tar.gz"

# Node configuration
nodes:
  count: 5  # Number of nodes to provision

  # Global metadata available to all nodes
  global_metadata:
    app_name: "my_distributed_app"
    version: "1.0.0"
    environment: "production"

  # Lists distributed across nodes (each node gets one item)
  distributed_lists:
    worker_ids: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    zones: ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b", "us-west-2c", "us-west-2a", "us-west-2b"]

  # Template for node-specific config
  config_template:
    log_level: "info"
    heartbeat_interval: 30
```

2. Deploy your application using the CLI:

```bash
# Deploy to daemon on localhost
taskfly up

# Deploy to remote daemon
taskfly --daemon-ip <daemon-ip> up
```

### Managing Deployments

```bash
# List all deployments
taskfly list

# Get deployment status
taskfly status --id <deployment-id>

# View logs from deployment (Docker-compose style)
taskfly logs --id <deployment-id>

# Follow logs in real-time
taskfly logs --id <deployment-id> --follow

# Filter logs by specific node
taskfly logs --id <deployment-id> --node <node-id>

# Terminate a deployment
taskfly down --id <deployment-id>
```

### Interactive Shell & Dashboard

```bash
# Start interactive shell
taskfly shell

# Within the shell, you can use these commands:
taskfly> dashboard     # Show live dashboard (refreshes every second, Ctrl+C to exit)
taskfly> list          # List all deployments
taskfly> status <id>   # Show deployment status
taskfly> logs <id>     # View logs
taskfly> down <id>     # Terminate deployment
taskfly> help          # Show all commands
taskfly> exit          # Exit shell

# Or run dashboard directly
taskfly dashboard
```

**Dashboard Features:**
- **System Resources**: Total CPU cores, load average, memory usage, active nodes
- **Deployment Overview**: Deployment counts by status (running, provisioning, completed, failed)
- **Recent Deployments**: Last 5 deployments with progress bars
- **Node Metrics**: Per-node CPU, load, memory, and last update time
- **Color-coded alerts**: Green (healthy), Yellow (70-90% utilization), Red (>90% utilization)
- **Auto-refresh**: Updates every second with live data

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

#### TaskFly CLI
- `TASKFLY_DAEMON_IP` - IP address of the TaskFly daemon (default: `localhost`)
- `TASKFLY_DAEMON_PORT` - Port of the TaskFly daemon (default: `8080`)
- `TASKFLY_VERBOSE` - Enable verbose logging

#### TaskFly Daemon
- `TASKFLY_LISTEN_IP` - IP address to listen on (default: `0.0.0.0`)
- `TASKFLY_LISTEN_PORT` - Port to listen on (default: `8080`)
- `TASKFLY_DAEMON_IP` - Public IP for nodes to callback (default: `localhost`)
- `TASKFLY_DAEMON_PORT` - Public port for node callbacks (default: `8080`)
- `TASKFLY_VERBOSE` - Enable verbose logging
- `TASKFLY_DEPLOYMENT_DIR` - Directory for deployment files (default: `deployments`)

### CLI Flags

```bash
# Global flags (available for all commands)
--daemon-ip, -d     IP address of daemon (default: "localhost")
--daemon-port, -p   Port of daemon (default: "8080")
--verbose, -v       Enable verbose logging

# Example usage
taskfly --daemon-ip 10.0.0.1 --daemon-port 8080 list
taskfly -d 10.0.0.1 -p 8080 dashboard
```

### Node Configuration Patterns

TaskFly supports flexible node configuration through three mechanisms:

#### 1. Global Metadata
Shared configuration available to all nodes:
```yaml
global_metadata:
  app_name: "my_app"
  database_url: "postgres://..."
  api_key: "secret123"
```

#### 2. Distributed Lists
Values distributed evenly across nodes (round-robin):
```yaml
distributed_lists:
  worker_ids: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Node 0 gets 1, Node 1 gets 2, etc.
  regions: ["us-west", "us-east"]  # Cycles through values
```

#### 3. Config Template
Static configuration for each node:
```yaml
config_template:
  memory_limit: "2G"
  timeout: 300
```
